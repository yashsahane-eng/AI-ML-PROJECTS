## 🚀 How to Run Each Project

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yashsahane-eng/AI-ML-PROJECTS.git
cd AI-ML-PROJECTS
Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # macOS / Linux
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Open a Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook
Select the notebook you want to explore.

🧩 Sample Projects (Describe Each)
Fill in these sections with real summaries for each notebook you have.
